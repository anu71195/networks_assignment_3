# Socket-programming TCP based implementation
Setting up a server and a client side using socket programming,implementing the crc algorithm after converting the data stream to binary form and implementing the retransmission,timeout features of TCP.

The Server is made to be a concurrent server without the use of multithreading.

Data is being sent along with the checksum generated by CRC.
On being recieved server sends ACK or NACK based on error-free/error contaning message(from checksum) .
On recieving ACK sends transmission complete message.
On recieving Nack retransmits the message.
On recieving none discards the message and waits for a ack/nack till (timeout) time.

Also implemented is an error generating algo for the bits in the data being sent from the client to the server and the ACK/NACK sent to the client from the server.

CRC-8 is being used in this current implementation.
(x^8+x^2+x+1)


Running the program :
Open 2 terminals
gcc -o cl.c client in T1
gcc -o se.c server in T2

./server <port_no> in T2
./client <host_name> <port_no> in T1

port_no  : any valid port number eg: 2654,8888,.....
host_name: valid host name/address
